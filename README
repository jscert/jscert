REQUIREMENTS

Files compile with Coq v8.4. If your Coq binaries are not in the
default location (/usr/bin/ or /usr/local/bin/), you need to create a
file called "settings.sh" and set COQBIN to the appropriate path, e.g.:
COQBIN=/var/tmp/coq8.4/bin/

You also need subversion to get TLC (else you need to import the TLC
library by hand).

*********************************************************************
INSTALLATION AND COMPILATION

1) Run "make init" to install TLC and Flocq (requires subversion)

2) Run "make" to compile the files (ignore the warnings),
   Run "make -j 2" if your machine has two cores.

3) Run "./open.sh & " to edit files in CoqIDE

4) Run "make clean" to clean JS files,
   Run "make clean_all" to also clean in TLC and Flocq

USING THE CERTIFIED INTERPRETER

The interpreter is defined and proven in the file “JsInterpreter.v” by
the functions “run_expr”, “run_stat” and “run_prog” (and the theorems
“run_expr_correct”, “run_stat_correct” and “run_prog_correct”). As
every function must terminate in Coq, its first argument is the
maximum number of step the computation has to last.  This function
returns one of the three following output:
- out_bottom, when the computation lasts longer than the "max_step" argument.
- out_unspec, when the output result is unspecified.
- out_return h r, when the computation ran without problem,
  returning the heap state h and the result r.
  Note that the result may be an error.

There is a boolean parameter “Mnostuck” stating what should be done
when no reduction rule in “red_expr”, “red_stat” or “red_prog” can be
applied.  If it is set to true, then it returns an error, otherwise it
stops and returns “out_unspec”.

Examples of code generation are given in the file “JsInterpreterExample.v”.

The first step is to define a Javascript program using the grammar of JsDefs.
See the definition of the objects “prog1” and “prog2”. The “seq” construction
just constructs a tree of “exp_seq” with its arguments list. Then you have to
define its run (it is the definition of “computation1” and “computation2”),
 in the initial heap and the default scope [loc_global ; loc_scope].

Once you have defined it, you can extract it with the line
"Extraction "js/interpreter.ml" fresh_for_list <your computation>."
Note that "fresh_for_list" have to be extracted too.
This will create a file "interpreter.ml" which contains the ocaml source code.
To compile it, you can use the "make interpreter" command.
The executable won't output anything though, so you should use the interpreter
"ocaml" to see the result.

Type "#use "interpreter.ml";;" to load the interpreter code, including
 the result of the computation.  The result may be too complex to be displayed,
so you can need the following commands to see it:
    #print_length 10_000;;
    computation2;;
If you want to make sense of the heap, you need to use another small tool:
   #use "../tools/prheap.ml";;
   main computation2;;
This will dump some text that you can copy and paste in a dot file,
which you can look with tools like graphviz.
At the top of each cell is the location.  If there is a "null" in the bottom left,
 it means the prototype is loc_null, and if there is an "obj_pr"
the prototype is "obj_proto" (this gather many common cases).
At the bottom right is the common this field (glob for loc_global).
Scopes are written as list of locations, as in "8 | global | scope".
